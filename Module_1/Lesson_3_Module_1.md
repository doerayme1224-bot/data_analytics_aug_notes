### Using Google colabs


First I went onto a *google drive* and made sure i was *on my personal drive*

then i *opened a new folder* and gave it a title 

in that folder, i made *another folder* and titled it as well 

after that, i put in a *csv. file of the data* that i got from kaggle 

i opened *google colabs* after that 

then i *changed the name* of google colabs to main 

i wrote code with a *print instruction and the value "hi"* and ran it with *ctrl enter*

summary: To use google colabs, what you need to do first is to open your google drive(make sure you are in the folder you want to use). after you have opened your google 
drive and made sure you are in a folder you want, you right click on the empty space in a folder and look at more. in more there should be google colabs (if it isn't you need to install it). 

ctrl mm


what we did to day was download files from a open source dataset, make a repository with github, made folder with google drive, we also use dcolabs to display the dataset then we saved a copy on github
