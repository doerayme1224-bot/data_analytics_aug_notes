# Lesson 9: Realationships Between Variables
**Correlation** (often denouted as "r")
Statistical concept which measures how much two numbered variables will change together
Helps us evaluate trends
Correlation is represented on a scale from -1 to +1
+1: Perfect Positive Correlation (as one variable increases, the other variable also increases) 
-1: Perfect Negative Correlation (as one variable increase, the other variable decreases)
0: No Correlation (no linear realationship between the two variables)

*Correlation Doesn't Mean Causation*
Two variables can have the same correlation, but that doesn't mean thart one variable is responsible for the other

**Correlation Coefficeints**
if correlation (c) (0 < c <= +1) this means Positive Correlation
if correlation (c) (0 > c >= -1) this means Negative Correlation
if correlation (c) ( c = 0 ) This means no Correlation. The variable is not affected by changes from the other variable

**Strength of Correlation**
*Common Threshhold for Interpreting Correlation Strength*
0.8 <= c <= 1 : Strong Correlation (Substantial realationship between Variables)
0.6 <= c < 0.8 : Moderate Correlation (Noticeahble realationship between Variables)
0.2 <= c < 0.6 : Mild Correlation (Weak realationship between Variables)
c < 0.2 : No Correlation

**Simple Linear Regression**

Statiscal Tool which models the relationship between two continous variables with a linear equation to observed data
It Identifies a Linear relationship between two variables, Which allows us to predict a Variable based on the Value of the other (line of best fit)
ther "line of best Fit" allows us to make predictions
Regression Equation (y = mx + b)
allows you to make predictions of a variable given the value of the other variable

*Limitations of Lineaer Regression*
Assumption of linearity
Assumes all relationships between variables is (doesn't hold true for all datasets)
Outliers
Can heavily skew or distort the results of analysis, Which leads to innacurate data
