This Module served as an intro to data analytics
I learned about different types of data analytics
- Descriptive: what has happened
- Diagnostic: what to do about it 
- Predictive: what will happen
- Perscriptive: what to do about what will happen

I also Learned about the data analytics cycle
1. Develop Questions
2. Collect Data
3. Prep the Data
4. Analyze the Data 
5. Present Results

then I learned about the different types of data
- Quantitative: numerical data
- Qualitative: describes a quality (color, texture, etc.)
and its subsets
- Ordinal: data with a heirarchical order
- Nominal: data that has no set order 
- Discrete: data  that has a set range
- Continuous: data that can take any set of values

then opensource datasets: datasets that are freely available for public use

then after that I learned about measures of central tendency
- Mean: the average
- Median: the middle peice of data in a dataset
- Mode: the most reaccurring peice of data

then I learned about Measures of position and disperssion
position
- Percentiles: shows where a certain percent of observations fall below
- Quartiles: percentiles but broken into thirds (25%, 50%, 75%)
Disperssion
- range: shows the difference between the largest and smallest data set
- variance: shows by how much the values deviate away from the mean
- standard deviation: shows how much the values deviate from eachother


then I learned about different visualizattions of data
- bar chart
- histogram 
- boxplot


then I learned about probabilty (how likely something is to haappen)
- normal distribution: spread of data around an average (bell shaped curve)
- hypothesis testing


then I learned about correlation
- correlation coeffeceints
- strength of correlation
- Linear Regresiion


Then I learned about Logic Trees and how to build them 

# to do
The only things I still have yet to do for this module are the presentations and i also beleie that I need to finish up the notes for lessons 1 and lessons 4
