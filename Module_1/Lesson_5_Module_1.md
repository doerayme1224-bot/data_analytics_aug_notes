# Lesson 5: Measures Of Central Tendency 

## Descriptive Statistics
Help us *Summarize, Organize, and Explain characteristics* of a dataset
They're great when dealing with *Multiple Values*

## Measures Of Central Tendency
**Mean**
Average of a dataset 

mean = All Values/ Amount of Observations
![Mean Formu;a Example](https://cdn.disco.co/media/image_fffc57f2-1008-4b25-9986-7fdf04fb7be4.png)
*Con*: can be distorted by outliers

**Median**
Middle Value of Dataset (when in ascending order)
For Odd number of Observations: The Medians the Middle Value
For Even Number: the Median is the Average of the two middle numbers
Ex: [10, 15, 20, 25]

Not Affected By outliers like Mean

**Mode**
Most Reoccuring value in dataset
[10, 20, 20, 25, 30]
mode = 20
There can be Multiple modes("bimodal", "Multimodal") or none at all

**Choosing the Best Central Tendency**
Mean: Best for Datasets with no Outliers
Median: Best for Skewed Datasets with Outliers
Mode: Good for Categorical Data and seeing the most frequent value
