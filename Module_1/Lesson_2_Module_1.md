### lesson 2 Data Analytics Cycle
[[General Data Analytics]]


**Step 1. Develop Questions**

The *SMART Framework* is a powerful tool for *defining problems effectively*. It converts *ambiguous challenges into precise, focused statements*. This acronym stands for *Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound criteria.*

Specific: Formulate *precise and well-defined statements.*
Measurable: Determine *how you will evaluate project success.*
Achievable: Ensure your project goals are *realistic and attainable.*
Relevant: Align your project with *broader objectives.*
Time-bound: Establish clear *deadlines for project completion.*



**Step 2. Collect Data**

let's identify some common sources from which data is typically extracted:

Databases: These are *structured collections of data* organized to facilitate *efficient retrieval and management*. Throughout this bootcamp, you will gain proficiency in working with both *SQL and no-SQL databases*.

Spreadsheet Files: These are *grid-based files* similar to those used in *Microsoft Excel.* Typically, you'll find a *.xlsx* extension at the end of these files.

Text Files: These are files containing text. Common formats include comma-separated values *(.csv) and plain text (.txt)*.



**Step 3. Prep the Data**

Adhering to the principle of *"Garbage in, garbage out,"* emphasizes the importance of thorough data cleaning to ensure the reliability of results.

Common Data Cleaning Challenges

Imagine you're a data analyst for a healthcare organization tasked with analyzing patient health records. As you dive into the data, you encounter several challenges:

*Missing Values*: Some patient records lack crucial information, such as blood pressure readings or medication history.
*Outliers*: Certain patient records exhibit extreme values, potentially skewing statistical analysis.
*Inconsistent Formats*: Dates of medical procedures are recorded inconsistently, with variations in formatting (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY vs. DD/MM/YYYY).
*Duplicate Entries*: Some patients have multiple entries in the dataset, leading to redundant information and potential inaccuracies.



**Step 4. Analyze Data**

This stage involves data analysts engaging in *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*, a method that encompasses a *thorough visual and statistical exploration of the data* to deepen the understanding of its characteristics. This process entails *generating summary statistics, visualizations, and graphs* to uncover patterns and relationships. We'll delve into the intricacies of conducting EDA further in our upcoming lessons.



**Step 5. Present Results**

When preparing presentations for stakeholders, consider the following tips encapsulated in the acronym *CLEAR*:

- C - *Communicate Tailored Messages*: Communicate findings using accessible language and tailor messages based on the audience's background and needs.
- L - *Leverage Visual Impact and Engagement*:Use impactful visualizations and charts for clarity and memorability.Foster engagement through interactive methods.
- E - *Emphasize Actionable Insights*:Highlight how the results align with the objectives of the project.Give actionable insights for practical decision-making.
- A - *Adhere to Time*: Respect time limits for presentations by structuring content accordingly.
- R - *Remember to Maintain a Rhythm*: Keep your audience engaged.



**Additional Considerations**

Understanding *context is vital in data analysis* as it provides the *necessary background for accurately interpreting data*. Without context, data can be *easily misconstrued*, leading to flawed conclusions. For example, if customer satisfaction ratings for a product suddenly drop in a particular month, it might raise alarm bells. However, with the context of a known product issue that was promptly resolved, it becomes clear that the decline was temporary rather than indicative of a lasting problem. Context helps analysts draw informed conclusions that are reflective of the true situation.



**Data Quality**

Ensuring data quality *prevents erroneous conclusions* and *enhances decision-making effectiveness*.

*Completeness*: Ensure all necessary information is present and available for analysis.
*Validity*: Data should conform to defined business rules and accepted formats, ensuring it is suitable for its intended purpose.
*Uniqueness*: Each data point must be distinct, with no duplicate entries.
*Consistency*: Data should maintain uniformity across various applications and sources.
*Timeliness*: Data must be up-to-date and regularly refreshed to provide relevant insights.
*Accuracy*: The data should faithfully reflect real-world scenarios to minimize the risk of incorrect decisions.



**Biased vs Unbiased Data**

Understanding bias in data is essential for achieving accurate results.

Biased Data: This occurs *when information is systematically distorted* or unrepresentative of the entire population, leading to *inaccurate or unfair outcomes*. 

Unbiased Data: This *represents a diverse and fair sample* of the population, ensuring a comprehensive analysis.



**Ethical Considerations**

Ethical principles in data analysis are *paramount for fostering responsible practices* in your work. Key aspects include:

-*Privacy Protection and Data Anonymization*: Protect individual privacy by anonymizing data. This means altering or removing identifiable details, ensuring that individuals cannot be recognized from the data.
- *Informed Consent*: Always seek permission before using individualsâ€™ data. Clearly communicate the purpose and intended use of the data.
-*Fairness and Avoiding Bias*: Strive for fairness in your analyses by actively working to eliminate biases that could negatively affect specific groups.
