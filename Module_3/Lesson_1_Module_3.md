# Lesson 1 Intro to 
[[SQL]]
#### Sql
- Programming language used for relational databases 
**Used By**
- Data Analysts
- Database Administrators
- anyone wortking with relational databases
#### History
Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce.
Made it in the early 1970
Supposed to make Querying more simple, using less complex commands
ANSI standard by 1986
ISO standardized in 1987
refined to support:
- data insertion
- querying
- updates
- schema modification
#### Types of Databases
**Relational Databases (RDBMS)**
Store data in table rows and columns
- Structured Query Language (SQL): Provides a way to use the database.
- Data Integrity: Ensures data accuracy and reliability 
- Normalization: Reduces redundancy and improves data integrity 

**RDBMS Platforms**
- My SQL
- Oracle database
- Microsoft SQL server

**Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**
Handle Unstructured Data

**Types of NoSQL platforms:**
- Document Databases: Store data in document-like structures (e.g., MongoDB).
- Key-Value Stores: Simple key-value pairs for fast retrieval (e.g., Redis).
- Wide-Column Stores: Organize data by columns for large-scale queries (e.g., Cassandra).
- Graph Databases: Use nodes, edges, and properties for connected data (e.g., Neo4j).
#### Why SQL
Important for Querying, transforming and reporting data. Good for handling large datasets
- Great for careers
- Good for data manupulation
#### Envioroment for SQL
**DB beaver:** open source tool for doing things to files with SQLite. Lets you manage a database and query things without needing a database system
#### SQLite vs PostgreSQL
**SQLite**
- Lightweight
- Stores Database in single file
- Learn SQL fundamentals with Less complexity
**PostgreSQL**
- More advanced Features
- Works well with large datasets
- Enterprise/business level tasks with extenssive data mangement
