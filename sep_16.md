- file handling
- exception handling
- functions (connected to algorithims: a set of instructions)
- asynch (finish labs)
- collaborating git repository (clone, create branches, terminal work)

#### important to write every thing down
- to solve a problem you are stuck on, save progress, make a note on why it is working, and walk away (get less frustrated) 
**Learn Rust(not now but later for sure)**

`git branch -a`
git checkout *name of branch*
1. we used `git branch` to create a branch on a github repository
2. we used  `code .` inside the branch we created to open it in visual studio code
3. made a .md file on vs code and commited and pushed the changes to github 
- throughout the next classes, we will be focusing on projects

1. doc strings
2. Tell him if you used a website to find an answer
3. 


every function has a docstring
document your functions


'''python
"""
this is a docstring 
"""
'''


put in...
"""
created by:
input:
output:
"""

the zen of python: import this


#### google colab on functions
fix the add function
