All data files should be in one place (like a folder)



# what we did today 
1. I struggled github repositories
3. we played around with sql `from` and `select`
4. 
2. we converted a csv file into a database using sqlite3 and we opened it with dbeaver


# for csv file
1. in the terminal, run:
    - sqlite3 <NameOfDB.sqlite>
        - .mode csv
        - .import <NameOfCSV.csv> <NameOfTable>
2.
