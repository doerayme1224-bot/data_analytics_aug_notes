**[Client intro video](https://www.loom.com/share/3c22b01baf6348bf9ffe43a57e9e23ba?sid=cf4ee2db-e71f-4d59-b46b-9157b43efd81)**

In this video I became familiar with my client (the National Park Service)
It dove into background about my client
It dove into the Type of data they would collect (Like the amount of visitors they get or the amount of wildfires they get)
They also need to rely on data analysts for things like infographics
The National Park Service in this situation particular, needs our help with creating an infographic for their marketing team
we were also Given a number of tasks to complete
### Tasks
1. Total number of parks in the pacific northwest
2. most popular park in PNW based off of visitor numbers
3. Total Number of visitors in the pacific northwest
4. How do national park visitors use overnight options
### Tasks 1 to 2
**[Video Tasks 1-2](https://www.loom.com/share/45801112463443b8817facbaae240b05?sid=74f71de0-17d8-414c-99ac-1924edcc1806)**

Datasets may come with data dictionaries which offer more detailed desdscriptions as to what the specific  column may actually refer to
You can format things as a table under insert, which is nice cause they allow you to sart data with ease
We used the counta function to count all the values of the range to find out the amount of parks in the pacific northwest (task 1)
Then we used sort to find out which were the most popular parks (Task 2)
### Tasks 3 to 4
**[Video Tasks 3-4](https://www.loom.com/share/1e6aec258b484e278f53c1ab0b316a44?sid=197bcd7f-6214-4e57-a14b-cc69bb2c9b3a)**

we used the SUM function to se the total number of park visits in 2022 (task 3)
we did that three more times to find the amount of people that went camping in a tent, in a rv, and backcountry. after that we found the percentage of overnight campers by adding the values we got from people that camped under the stars and dividing that number by the total number of visits. (Task 4)
