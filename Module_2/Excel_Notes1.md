pick a dataset, Creta 5 subsets, 5 columns, 50 rows, sort each and every subset and, you must have 1 numerical column, creat three operations, write down behavior/ instructions

What I did First was go onto Google drive and I downloaded a the csv file for Hearing wellness data

then I opened the file by clicking on the csv in downloads, which opened it in excel 

then i opened five worksheets and gave them names

then i copied 5 columns and 50 rows from the main worksheet and pasted them in one of the five worksheets

then, on "Data For Hearing Wellness 1" I took the set os numerical data (under belief early hearing care) and preformed operations

one was sum: =SUM(C2:C50)
another was multiplication: =(C2*C3)
The last was sumif: =SUMIF(C2:C50,5)

Excel as a platform doesn't actually behave that strangely, which was particullarly helpful when it came to operations. when you type =SUM into excel, it shows a drop down which includes a number of different operations, like sumif or sumifs, and there is too many to remember, but if you hover over one of the operations, it tells you what to do. also something i found kindof annoying was that when i clicked on a specific cell then tried to paste onto it, it wouldn't paste, im guessing cause it can't paste info found from different cells onto one cell.


I forgot to sort
